This workshop is intended as a **discussion platform on Conversational AI for intelligent information access**, bringing together researchers and practitioners across natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and human-computer interaction fields. Among other topics, we will discuss design, evaluation and human factors in relation to automating information-seeking dialogues. The workshop will also feature a shared task on Conversational Question Answering.

SCAI 2022 is a 7th iteration of SCAI. This year, the workshop will focus on the discussion between researchers from different fields. It is therefore organized as a **strictly non-archival venue**, as an opportunity to present papers accepted to other venues in an interdisciplinary meeting specifically focused on search-based conversational AI. SCAI 2022 is a **hybrid workshop** at [SIGIR 2022](https://sigir.org/sigir2022/), taking place on 15 July (full day).

SCAI is already an established venue with a long-standing tradition of building bridges and integrating expertise from diverse research communities. It was previously organised in the context of ICTIR 2017, EMNLP 2018, TheWebConf 2019, IJCAI 2019 and EMNLP 2020, and as a separate online event in 2021. You can find materials from [SCAI 2021](2021/) on a separate page, the materials from 2016-2022 are at <https://scai-workshop.github.io>.


### Submission

#### Topics of interest

We invite presentations of **papers that were previously accepted** to conferences or journals within the last 2 years, and are relevant to the following topics:

* **Design**: theoretical understanding and empirical analysis of information-seeking dialogues, properties of a mixed-initiative interaction, modeling conversational contexts, relation to concurrent research in dialogue systems and conversational user interfaces 
* **Evaluation**: evaluation of conversational search systems including user studies, question answering and summarization metrics, Wizard-of-Oz experiments, user simulation for dialogues, measuring learning outcomes of an information-seeking dialogue, dialogue analysis, faithfulness and provenance of the dialogue responses
* **Applications**: information-seeking dialogues for personalised education, healthcare, entertainment and knowledge-intensive work

#### How to submit

The submission involves either a link to the published paper version, or a PDF if the paper isn’t online yet or is not open-access. The workshop organizers will select papers for presentation mainly based on their relevance to the workshop topic.

**Apply to present** your work at SCAI’22 (or nominate someone else’s work) by **[filling out this on-line form](https://forms.gle/vmG5gTWhnoHvw5TL8 )**.
