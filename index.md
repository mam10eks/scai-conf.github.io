<!-- ### Workshop overview: -->

This workshop is intended as a **discussion platform on Conversational AI for intelligent information access**, bringing together researchers and practitioners across natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and human-computer interaction fields. Among other topics, we will discuss design, evaluation and human factors in relation to automating information-seeking dialogues. The workshop will also feature a shared task on Conversational Question Answering.

SCAI is already an established venue with a long-standing tradition of building bridges and integrating expertise from diverse research communities. It was previously organised in the context of ICTIR 2017, EMNLP 2018, TheWebConf 2019, IJCAI 2019 and EMNLP 2020. To access the materials of the previous five editions of SCAI navigate to <https://scai-workshop.github.io>

While this is a 6th iteration of SCAI, this year, the workshop will focus on the discussion between researchers from different fields. It is therefore organized as a strictly non-archival venue, as an opportunity to present papers accepted to other venues in an interdisciplinary meeting specifically focused on search-based conversational AI.

The workshop is organized as an online event, with free participation.



### Submission

We invite presentations of papers that were previously accepted to conferences or journals within the last 2 years, and are relevant to the following topics: (1) theoretical foundations for automating information-seeking dialogues and its relation to the concurrent research directions in dialogue systems and conversational user interfaces, and (2) evaluation of conversational search systems including wizard-of-oz experiments, user studies, conversational question answering, response generation and summarization.

The submission involves either a link to the published paper version, or a PDF if the paper isn’t online yet or is not open-access. The workshop organizers will select papers for presentation mainly based on their relevance to the workshop topic.
