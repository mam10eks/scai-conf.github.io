<!-- ### Workshop overview: -->

This workshop is intended as a **discussion platform on Conversational AI for intelligent information access**, bringing together researchers and practitioners across natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning and human-computer interaction fields. Among other topics, we will discuss design, evaluation and human factors in relation to automating information-seeking dialogues. The workshop will also feature a shared task on Conversational Question Answering.

While this is a 6th iteration of SCAI, this year, the workshop will try to focus mainly on the discussion between researchers from different fields. It is therefore organized as a strictly non-archival venue, as an opportunity to present papers accepted to other venues in an interdisciplinary meeting specifically focused on search-based conversational AI.

The workshop is organized as an online event, with free participation.


### Submission

We invite submission of presentations for previously papers accepted to conferences or journals in the last 2 years, relevant to the topic of the workshop (see topics of interest below). The submission involves either a link to the published paper version, or a PDF if the paper isn’t online yet or is not open-access. The workshop organizers will select papers for presentation mainly based on their relevance to the workshop topic.
